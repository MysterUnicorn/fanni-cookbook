# Banana pancakes (about 20)

## Ingredients
2 overripe bananas that you would otherwise throw out
2 eggs
a dash of vanilla extract
3 dl milk
a pinch of salt
a packet of baking powder
1 1/2 cups flour
sugar or sweetener if you like

## Instructions
Make the bananas into a mush with a fork. Whisk it up first with the wet, then with the dry ingredients. Heat up a pan with a drop of oil on medium heat. Bake both sides of the pancakes for a few minutes. You can serve them with fruits, caramel, chocolate or whatever you prefer.

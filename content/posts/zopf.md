# Zopf for Easter

## Ingredients
3 dl warm milk (I use plant milk, usually oat)
1 packet instant dried yeast
3 tbsp sugar
500 g flour
a pinch of salt
50 g melted butter
1 egg for brushing

## Instructions
In a big bowl, mix milk, sugar and yeast. Let rise for about 15 minutes at a warm place.

Add flour, salt and butter and mix up a bit with a wooden spoon. Then switch to your hands and knead for some time to make a firm, smooth dough.

Cover with plastic foil and let rise for ideally 2 hours at a warm place. If you can, turn on the oven for a bit, then turn it off and open its door to let out the warm air. It's good for the dough.

When it's doubled in size, knead a little more and cut it up into as many pieces as your braid needs. The easiest version is 3 but if you feel like it, experiment with other variations.

Roll out the pieces of dough with your hand to form long snake-like things. Braid them, then brush the zopf with a beaten up egg. Let rise for another half an hour.

Preheat your oven to 180Â°C. Brush the zopf again with the egg, then put it in the oven for 35 minutes. It will turn brown relatively quickly but don't worry, that does not mean it's burnt.

When the zopf is ready, cool it to warm temperature, then slice up and eat with butter, jam or whatever you fancy.

# The best pizza dough

## Ingredients
1 1/2 cups warm water
2 tsp sugar
1 packed instant dried yeast
3 1/2 cups flour
2 tsp salt
2 tbsp olive oil

## Instructions
Mix water, sugar and yeast in a big bowl. Add all the other ingredients. Start mixing with a wooden spoon, then switch to your hands until the dough is smooth (about 5 minutes). Coat the dough with olive oil and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let it rise for at least 2 hours. If the air is cold, start the oven for some time beforehand and open its door.

Punch the air out of the dough and knead it for a bit. Preheat the over for the highest possible temperature (my oven can do 240Â°C). Wipe your pans with a paper towel and olive oil. Roll out the dough - it can be either thin or thick, whatever you prefer. Decorate it, then bace it for about 13 minutes.

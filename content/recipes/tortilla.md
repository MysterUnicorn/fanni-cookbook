# Flour tortillas

## Ingredients
2 cups flour
1 tsp salt
3/4 cup water
2 tbsp olive oil

## Instructions
Mix everything in a bowl until you get a firm dough. Then divide the dough into 6-8 equal parts and roll out thinly. You can also make 12-14 smaller ones if you plan to use them for tacos. Preheat a big pan and bake both sides of the tortillas on high heat. Cover them with a damp cloth so that they don't harden.
